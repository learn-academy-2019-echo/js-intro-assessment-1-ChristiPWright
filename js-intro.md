5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: There is a navigator and a driver. The navigator sets the direction for the code and the driver types the code. 

  Researched answer:
"As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa."
